Whether you should have a Docker registry or not depends on your specific use case and requirements. Let's understand the differences and purposes of both Docker images and Docker registries to help you make an informed decision.

# Docker Images
Docker images are the building blocks of containers. They are read-only templates that contain all the necessary instructions and dependencies to run a specific application. You create Docker images using a Dockerfile, which defines the steps to build the image. Once an image is created, you can use it to spin up multiple containers.
You can store Docker images on your local machine or push them to a Docker registry for sharing across different environments or with other developers.

# Docker Registry
A Docker registry is a centralized repository for storing and distributing Docker images. It acts as a server where you can push and pull Docker images from different locations. Docker Hub (hub.docker.com) is a public and widely used Docker registry, but you can also set up your private registry using tools like Docker Registry (also known as Docker Distribution) or other third-party solutions like Amazon ECR, Google Container Registry, etc.

# Reasons to have a Docker Registry

1. Centralized storage: A registry provides a centralized location to store Docker images, making it easy to manage and distribute them among different teams or servers.

1. Sharing and collaboration: If you're working in a team or need to share Docker images across different environments, a registry becomes invaluable as a common repository.

1. Versioning and access control: Some Docker registry solutions allow you to manage image versions and control access to images, ensuring only authorized users can access specific images.

1. Bandwidth savings: Docker registries can save bandwidth by allowing users to download images locally from the registry, rather than pulling them from external sources each time.

If your use case involves **multiple developers** or teams working on the same project, or if you need to distribute Docker images to **different environments**, having a **Docker registry** is highly recommended. It streamlines collaboration, version control, and ensures consistency across environments.

On the other hand, if you are **working solo** or within a limited environment and don't need to share or distribute Docker images extensively, using the **`docker images`** command and managing images locally might be sufficient for your needs.

Finally, you can always start with local image management and later integrate a Docker registry as your needs evolve.
