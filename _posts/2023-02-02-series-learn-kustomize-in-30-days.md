See [this post](https://ricardotorresdacosta.com/what-kustomize-solves/) to have a gentle overview of why Kustomize exists and [this one](https://ricardotorresdacosta.com/helm-vs-kustomize/) to see how it compares to Helm.

# 30-Day Plan to learn Kustomize
I drafted the following plan and will add links to each topic as I progress.
## Week 1: Introduction to Kustomize and YAML

**Days 1-2**: Introduction to Kustomize and why it's used. Also, learn about Kubernetes and its relation to Kustomize.

**Days 3-5**: Basics of YAML (Yet Another Markup Language), which is the language of Kustomize configuration files. Start from simple data structures, then go to more complex ones.

**Day 6-7**: Understand Kubernetes objects and their representation in YAML files. Explore how Kustomize works with these files and practice basic commands.

## Week 2: Understanding and Setting Up Kustomize

**Day 8-9**: Set up your environment for Kustomize and learn how to create base and overlay directories.

**Day 10-11**: Understand Kustomization files and their structure, and learn about Kustomize patches.

**Day 12-14**: Learn about generators (ConfigMapGenerator and SecretGenerator) and transformers, and understand how Kustomize can handle environment-specific changes.

**Day 15**: Study practical examples and use cases of Kustomize.

## Week 3: Hands-on Practice and Advanced Topics

**Day 16-18**: Start a project to consolidate your learning. Gradually add complexity and experiment with different scenarios.

**Day 19-21**: Learn about integrating Kustomize with CI/CD pipelines, managing secrets, and deploying applications in different environments.

**Day 22-23**: Understand the best practices for using Kustomize effectively and explore more advanced features.

**Day 24-25**: Continue with the implementation of advanced topics in your project.

## Week 4: Review and Mastery

**Day 26-27**: Review all the learned concepts and work on the areas of confusion or difficulty.

**Day 28-29**: Finalize your project and prepare it for demonstration. Learn about the future of Kustomize, its upcoming features, and how to stay updated.

**Day 30**: Review everything once more. Create a portfolio showcasing your work and create a video tutorial explaining how you used Kustomize in your project.
