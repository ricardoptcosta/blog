# Why should I learn about stateful apps in Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an orchestration platform that has become a standard for deploying and managing containerized applications, including both stateless and stateful applications. Here are a few reasons why it's important to learn about stateful applications in Kubernetes:

**Complexity of State Management**: Stateful applications manage data that persists and evolves over time. This could be user data, application settings, or any information that is stored and retrieved between sessions. Managing the persistent state is more complex than managing stateless applications, where each request is handled independently. Understanding stateful applications in Kubernetes will help you deal with this complexity.

**Persistent Storage Needs**: Stateful applications often require storage that persists beyond the lifecycle of individual containers. Kubernetes provides robust primitives such as Persistent Volumes (PV), Persistent Volume Claims (PVC), and StatefulSets for managing the lifecycle and storage of stateful applications. By understanding these, you can manage stateful apps more effectively.

**Increasing Demand**: Many modern software systems involve stateful components such as databases, caches, and message queues. These components are increasingly being run on Kubernetes, which means understanding stateful applications in Kubernetes is a valuable skill in today's job market.

**Resiliency and High Availability**: Stateful applications introduce additional concerns regarding data consistency and replication. To build highly available, resilient systems, you need to understand how to handle these concerns in a Kubernetes environment.

**Broad Applicability**: Although the principles are taught using Kubernetes, they apply broadly to distributed systems. So, the understanding gained can be used outside of just Kubernetes.

Learning about stateful applications in Kubernetes can help you better design, deploy, and manage applications, ensuring they run reliably and efficiently. It's a valuable addition to the skillset of any software engineer, systems administrator, or DevOps professional.

# Deep dive into Stateful Apps in Kubernetes for 60 days

I drafted the following plan and will add links to each topic as I progress.
