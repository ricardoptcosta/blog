# What is a database?

In the context of computing, a database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases are used to hold information like text, numbers, images, and other types of data. The main purpose of a database is to operate large amounts of information by storing, retrieving, and managing data efficiently.

Crucially, when we talk about databases we usually refer to systems that provide a **complex, structured, and efficient way to store, query, and manipulate data**. That is why while a filesystem or an object store such as AWS S3 can be used to store and retrieve data, they are not considered databases.

# Why should I learn about databases?

Understanding databases is crucial for several reasons, especially if you're interested in software development, data analysis, or any IT-related field. Here are some reasons why learning about databases is important:

**Data Management**: Databases are fundamental to managing and organizing data in an efficient and structured way. They allow you to store, retrieve, modify, and delete data efficiently, which is crucial for many software applications.

**Relevance Across Industries**: Almost every industry uses databases in some form. Whether it's tech, finance, healthcare, education, or government, all sectors have a need to store and manage data, making knowledge about databases widely applicable.

**Informed Decision Making**: Companies rely heavily on databases to make strategic decisions. Understanding how databases work helps you better understand how such decisions are made.

**Career Opportunities**: Many jobs in the IT sector require knowledge of databases. Roles such as database administrator, data analyst, data scientist, back-end developer, and others all require a good understanding of databases.

**Interacting with Big Data**: Databases are key to managing big data. As companies generate more data than ever before, the ability to handle, analyze, and derive insights from such data (using technologies like Hadoop, Spark, etc.) is a highly sought-after skill.

**Web Development**: If you're interested in web development, most web applications need a database to store user data, posts, transactions, etc. Hence, understanding databases is crucial for building functional and efficient web applications.

**Future Trends**: With the rise of machine learning and AI, databases are becoming even more crucial for storing the massive amounts of data needed for these systems to learn.

**Practical Knowledge**: Understanding databases allows you to develop solutions for real-world problems since it enables you to organize, manipulate, and retrieve data efficiently.

**Scalability**: Understanding databases can help you design systems that are capable of managing an increasing amount of work in an efficient manner, a concept known as scalability.

**Data Security**: Databases often contain sensitive information. Knowledge about databases will equip you with the necessary skills to protect that information from potential threats.

Learning about databases not only equips you with a critical skill set, but it also broadens your understanding of how different technologies and systems interact, making you a more versatile professional in the IT field.

# Learn about Databases in 30 days

This plan assumes that you already have a basic understanding of computer science and programming. I drafted the following plan and will add links to each topic as I progress.
