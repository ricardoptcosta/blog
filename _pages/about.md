I'm the gardener in this little digital garden. You can call me Ric but most people call me Ricardo. I'm a software engineer, writer, speaker and investor with a focus on Cloud Native technologies and Security. I currently spend most of my time playing around with Kubernetes, Operators and setting up POCs for terrible ideas! 

I spend my time in between London and Porto. I am a happily married father of one.

On a previously life I studied and worked on the Economics field. I completed a BSc in Economics from University College London and a MSc in Economics for Development from Oxford University. I worked as an Economist at the Ministry of Education of Mozambique and at the World Bank. 

At some point, I realised I had too much creative energy and looking at my career I couldn't see how I would ever deploy it. This made me take a gamble and move into entrepeneurship. I started and ran Dalbek, an e-commerce startup, for a few years. During my tenure managing it I was exposed to the magic of software engineering. The bug was seeded and in 2019 I finalised the sale of my business after what felt like a very long road-show to investors.



Ricardo co-founded in 2014 the e-commerce startup Dalbek and delivered a successful exit in 2019.
