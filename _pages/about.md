I'm the gardener in this little digital garden. You can call me Ric but most people call me Ricardo. I'm a software engineer, writer and speaker with a focus on Cloud Native technologies and security. I currently spend most of my time playing around with Kubernetes, Operators and developing proof of concepts for terrible ideas! 

On a previous life, I geeked out over Economics. I studied at University College London and Oxford University. I worked as an Economist at the Ministry of Education of Mozambique and at the World Bank. However, at some point, I realised my career path was probably not going to allow me to deploy the endless amounts of creative energy I had in me. This made me take a gamble and move into entrepeneurship. I co-founded and ran [Dalbek](https://www.caixasbaratas.pt/), an e-commerce startup, for a few years. During my tenure managing it, I was exposed to the magic of software engineering. The bug was planted and in 2019 I finalised the sale of my business after what felt like a very long road-show to investors. Ever since, I've been dedicating the full amount of my working hours to computers and code. 

I spend my time in between London and Porto. I am a happily married father of one. When I am not coding, I'm probably spending time with my family and/or doing household chores. I'm still an avid reader of the Economist and the Financial Times
